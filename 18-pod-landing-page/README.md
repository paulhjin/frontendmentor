### Useful resources
- [Stack Overflow - Changing Color of SVG using filter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22252472/how-to-change-the-color-of-an-svg-element) Instead of changing the color in the actual SVG file, accomplished the same outcome by adding a class to the img and adding a filter property to the SVG which resulted in the desired color. 
- [Code Pen - CSS Filter Generator from Black to Target Color](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) This Code Pen outputs the CSS filter needed to change the SVG from a black to desired color. Note: Make sure to use "brightness(0) saturate(100%)" to set the color to base color to black then apply the filter.
