## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I've tried using a BEM-style approach in writing CSS but quickly realized it can be daunting and unnecessary for small pages and component challenges. So I figured a way out to shorten the CSS that I write by using a utility based approach Kevin Powell uses similar to Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. I will implement more of this style moving forward to make my CSS cleaner and shorter.
